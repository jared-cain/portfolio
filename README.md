================

This portfolio was created as a landing page to showcase my abilities as a full
stack web developer. My main areas of focus in this project are:

1. Node.js
2. Javascript
3. HTML5/CSS3/LESS
4. Automation
5. Heroku Ready

`$ npm install`

In the file _js/contactEmail.js_, you will need to update the user and
password to your own account.

This website uses a service called **nodemailer** to send the contact email.
